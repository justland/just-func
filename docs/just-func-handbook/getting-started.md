The compiler/interpreter/Repl for `just-func` itself will be implemented in the future, but not yet.

To use `just-func`, you can choose a hosting language in one of the supported languages below:

- ðŸš§ [just-func-python](https://github.com/justland/just-func-python)
- ðŸš§ [just-func-php](https://github.com/justland/just-func-php)

You will need to install the tool or library in that language.
