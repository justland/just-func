# Getting Started

While `just-func` is a functional programming language itself,
its own compiler and standard library is still a work in progress.

But that's completely ok because `just-func` is designed to be portal and can be executed in various `hosting languages`.

That means your application can still be written in your own language while still able to consume and execute `just-func` code.

## installation

Currently, `just-func` is supported in `python` and `PHP`.

To install `just-func` in `python`:

```sh
pip install just-func
```

- [just-func-python](https://github.com/justland/just-func-python)

To install `just-func` in `PHP`:

```sh
composer require JustLand/JustFunc
```

- [just-func-php](https://github.com/justland/just-func-php)

Supports in other languages are coming.
Trust me, they are coming. ðŸš€
