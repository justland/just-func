# Design Goals

## functional programming and data oriented

Encapsulation is a hoax.

Among functional programming languages,
there are pure functional programming languages,
and functional programing language with OO support.

Yes, functional programing and object oriented programing paradigm can co-exist.
And it CAN be a good thing.

However, in reality these OO support are added not because it makes the code cleaner and more coherent,
but because of technical limitation or as a marketing tool to lure programmers into the language.

The bottom line is, there are many ways to get the benefits provided by object oriented paradigm,
or class based object oriented paradigm to be precise,
and do a better job at it while keeping your code more efficient and clean.
