# Design Choices

Design choices de

Here we describe the design choices we made,
why we made them, and what are the implications and limitations they impose.

There are 5 stages for design choices:

- 💡 stage 0: proposing the idea. We should discuss on what problems do it solve, the pros and cons, what are the options.
- 🔍 stage 1: detailed use cases, challenges and propose solution
- ❓ stage 2: specification ready. Open for review.
- 🏗️ stage 3: specification complete.
- ✔️ stage 4: implementation complete

## Based on JSON

🏗️ stage 3

`just-func` is based on JSON.
At such, it can be sent and received by any services and applications using existing communication mechanism.

Supporting features:

- `just-func` JSON syntax highlighter
- `just-func` JSON formatter

## `jf` syntax

💡 stage 0

While reading `just-func` written in JSON is not a problem with the right tools,
writing `just-func` in JSON can be cumbersome and tedious.

Having a simplified specialized syntax that can be transformed to JSON would be highly desirable.

This specialized syntax can be based on JSON5 or a special declarative syntax.

Supporting features:

- `jf` parser
- `jf` syntax highlighter
- `jf` formatter

## identifier specification

🔍 stage 1

In order to make `just-func` easy to read and write,
The identifiers in `just-func` should carry as much information as possible while not losing readability.

There are a few things to consider:

- access modifier: how to indicate an identifier is public, private, or internal?
- namespacing: how to indicate the identifier comes from specific package or sub-namespace?
- expressiveness: how to retain expressiveness of the identifier so that developer can express their intent without compromise?
- interoperability: the identifier in `just_func` should be a valid identifier in other languages, so that they can manipulate `just_func` JSON without using indexer notation (`x['a-b']` vs `x.a_b`)

Here is a proposal:

- `Public`, `internal`, `_private`
- `Namespace1_Namespace2_Foo`

## type is first-class

💡 stage 0

`meta-programming` or `type-level programming` should be the same as `value-level programming`.

This allows types to be fully expressible.

There is a concern about compiler and language server performance,
so more details need to be added to fully understand if there are certain limitation can be applied.

## type declaration

💡 stage 0

One of the consideration of whether supporting type declaration is to whether if `just-func` would support function overload.

## lazy evaluation

💡 stage 0

To support lazy evaluation, it requires iterator and state machine implementation.

## monoid-identifier → identity

💡 stage 0

Calling `type-identifier` without data will return the identity for that type.

## Distributed Function Signature Addition

💡 stage 0

Modules can add function signatures to existing types or functions.
This is similar to function overloads,
but actually more similar to Rust `impl` and Lua method declaration.

## Uniformity over syntax overload

🔍 stage 1

Creating syntax overload to "make it easy" for the programmer almost always bite back.

Want to look for an example?
Look no further than the most popular language: JavaScript.

Is it popular? Yes.

Is it successful? Yup.

Is it controversial? You bet.

Does people hate it? You better believe.

Can it do better? Hell yeah.

## object as data type

🏗️ stage 3

In `just-func`, we are using the first element of an `array` to inject syntax to otherwise just a JSON.
For `object`, it is use as simple data structure, except the array inside an object also consider as a `just-func` expression.

This is a design choice to keep the language simple and flexible.

For example,
we could have use `object` to define function parameters,
but that creates limitation as the key of `object` can only be `string` or `number`,
thus the homoiconicity will suffer (we will have a hard time to build the parameter with meta-programming).

## Packages

💡 stage 0

The package behavior between different hosting languages should be the same.
But strictly enforcing that does not work because the author of a package typically implement it for a specific hosting language.

This means we need to define package differently than most other languages.

### each package should have a complimentary spec package

💡 stage 0

This spec package contains tests written in `just-func` as well as the schema.
It is used to ensure implementation of the same package in different hosting languages behave the same.

### each package should provide a schema to describe the API of the package

💡 stage 0

❓ Maybe using `protobuf` as the schema?
Another option is SWIG, but most likely `protobuf` is a better choice.

### need a proper package manager

🔍 stage 1

The package manager for `just-func` will be a bit more complicated than others.

First, there is **hosting platforms** and **consuming platforms**.

**Hosting platforms** means where the `just-func` code will be executed.
**Consuming platforms** means where the `just-func` code will be written or created from.

In the **hosting platform**, the corresponding `just-func` runtime and packages will be installed.

The developer will call the `just-func` runtime from the **hosting language** to handle the `just-func` code.

In the **consuming platform**, the schema or type definitions will be installed.
They are used to providing better development experience.
The packages installed does not need to have an implementation in the **consuming platform**.

Adding **hosting platforms** information in the **consuming platform** so that we can validate if the package install will work could be problematic,
because one **consuming platform** can talk to multiple **hosting platforms** and services,
and each of them can have different set of installed packages and versions.

One way to solve that is by providing a built-in communication channel,
much like WCF in .NET.
But that will require much more effort and should be considered in the future.
