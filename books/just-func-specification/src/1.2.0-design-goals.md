# Design Goals

The design goals of `just-func` describe the desire traits of the language.
They describe what the users of `just-func` should expect,
and what do we want them to feel in the long term.

The actual decisions made to satisfy these goals are described in the [design choices](./1.3.0-design-choices.md).

## Simple and consistent syntax

The `just-func` syntax should be simple so that it is easy to learn,
and consistent so that it is easy to read.

## Standardized packages

One primary goals of `just-func` is to share logic across different `hosting languages`.
That means the dependencies used by the logic must behave the same everywhere.



This means both naming and behavior of those packages must be the same.

To achieve that, the schema and specs of the packages should be uploaded to the `just-func` repository,
so that they can be centralized and used by implementations to test their behavior.

## Linear Learning Curve

The syntax and complexity of the code should grow linearly.
Or else it won't be consistent and easy to read.

Otherwise it will violates the language goal of [being the communication language](./1.1.0-language-goals.md#as-the-communication-language-between-teams).

To achieve this goal, we need:

- [](./1.3.0-design-choices.md#support-meta-programming-without-additional-syntax)

## Focus on Tooling

## Structural Type

Definitely supports structural type first instead of restricting the whole system with nominal type.

No question asked.

ðŸš§ to discuss:

The type syntax is still not defined.

## Strongly Type with type inference

Use type inference to infer types whenever possible.

## dynamically typed

Dynamically typed means the type of the variable is checked during runtime.

`just-func` is dynamically typed because it can be executed by the `hosting language` at runtime.
Even thou some `hosting language` might able to JIT compile `just-func` code making it possible to be statically typed,
most other `hosting language` would interpret it meaning `just-func` code must support runtime type checking.
